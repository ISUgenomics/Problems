No known solution


#first attempt outline
random sampling of reads from different intervals but only retain the names
retain the SAM aligned subfile
Determine which read names are missing a pair
Add in the paired reads and resort

Risk doubling the number of reads in really deep areas.
Could reapply same random filter level a second time to reduce this effect.
